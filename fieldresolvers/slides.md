Some things to review before diving in

- GraphQL refresher
- Graph data model
- Problems graphql attempts to solve
- An API panacea?

---

# Refresher

## What is GraphQL?

An open source query language and runtime for API's.

## Cool, what does that mean?

- A type system for describing your API and its data as a schema.
- A query language to interact with that API.
- An engine to execute queries against that API.

---

# Refresher

Schemas and types

A GraphQL API is backed by a schema, containing the types and operations for that API.

```graphql
type Query {
  animal(id: ID!): Animal
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

---

# Refresher

Schemas and types

All schemas have a root Query type that lists the queries the service supports.

Ours schema exposes one field in our query called `animal` which returns an `Animal` by `ID`.

```graphql {1-3|2}
type Query {
  animal(id: ID!): Animal
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

---

# Refresher

Schemas and types

GraphQL supports scalars (`String`, `Boolean`, `Int`, `ID`) as well as objects, lists, and more.

`Animal` is an object type with scalar fields `ID`, `String` and `Int`.

```graphql {5-9|6|7|8}
type Query {
  animal(id: ID!): Animal
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int!
}
```

---

# Refresher

Executing a query

GraphQL is just the specificiation. We need a library that implements the specificiation for our language.

We also need a way to make this implementation accessible, typically done by wrapping it with an HTTP handler.

There are many libraries for creating a GraphQL server.

# Refresher

Query structure

```graphql {|1|2,6,12,16|3-5,13-15}
query readAnimal {
  animal(id: "2ba43365-973a-41eb-87ff-b6033f332885") {
    id
    name
    age
  }
}

"""result
{
  "data": {
    "animal": {
      "id": "2ba43365-973a-41eb-87ff-b6033f332885",
      "name": "George",
      "age": 7
    }
  }
}
"""
```

---

# Refresher

Querying what we want

We can modify our query to return only the data we're interested in.

```graphql {|3,11}
query readAnimal {
  animal(id: "2ba43365-973a-41eb-87ff-b6033f332885") {
    name
  }
}

"""result
{
  "data": {
    "animal": {
      "name": "George"
    }
  }
}
"""
```

---

# Thinking in graphs

##

Our types can also express relationships (this is where the _Graph_ of GraphQL comes in)

```graphql {|,12-15|9}
type Query {
  animal(id: ID!): Animal
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  owners: [Human!]
}

type Human {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

---

# Thinking in graphs

##

We can also query these relationships

```graphql {|,3-5,12-16}
query georgeOwners {
  animal(id: "2ba43365-973a-41eb-87ff-b6033f332885") {
    owners {
      name
    }
  }
}

""" result
{
  "data": {
    "owners": [
      {
        "name": "Jake"
      }
    ]
  }
}
"""
```

---

# What is GraphQL trying to solve?

This is not an exhaustive list ðŸ˜‰

- Helps us model our types and their relationships as a graph
- Helps us fetch just the data we need
  - Overfetching
  - Underfetching
- Allows us to fetch this data from a single resource

---

# GraphQL, an API panacea?

> /ËŒpanÉ™ËˆsÄ“É™/
>
> _noun_

> **a solution or remedy for all difficulties or diseases.**

## Absolutely not

Engineering decision making involves tradeoffs, not perfect solutions.

GraphQL fits our domain well due to the hierarchical nature of our data. It allows us to build a flexible system that exposes data in an intuitive and performant way.

But this comes with additional verbosity, complexity, and challenges such as managing performance and keeping our schema backwards compatible.

With the right approaches we'll continue to build highly flexible systems.

---

# Recap

It's fields all the way down...

- Our schema has a query type
- This query type has fields for the various queries we support
- Those queries can return scalar values (strings, numbers, etc) or complex values like objects
- The objects we return have their own sets of fields, these can also be scalar values or complex types

## Some new info...

- GraphQL implementations will generally coerce scalar and object values as long as keys match
- Fields can be backed by a resolver
- This changes the behavior of the query
- That resolver is only executed if that field is requested

---

# Revisiting an earlier example

Our pet friends API

We have the following GraphQL schema

Our `Animal` type has an `owners` field which is a list of `Human` type.

```graphql {|9,12-15}
type Query {
  animal(id: ID!): Animal
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  owners: [Human!]
}

type Human {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

---

# Let's look at some resolvers

_Disclaimer: we're about to enter psuedo code land, where things work simply because I want them to_

---

# Example 1

##

First, the simplest version of our query. It resolves the entire `Animal` in one call.

We query the database and use a sql join to retrieve the related owner data.

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async animal({ parent, args, { db } }): Promise<Animal> {
      const animal = await db.queryRow(
        `SELECT a.id, a.name, a.age, o.id, o.name FROM animals a
         INNER JOIN owners o ON o.animal_id = a.id
         WHERE a.id = $1`,
        params["id"]
      );
      return animal;
    },
  },
};
```

---

# Example 1

## Pros

- Simple
- Quick to implement
- For small models and relations (especially 1:1), performance should be fine
- This approach can work great initially or on smaller projects

## Cons

- May end up with additional relationships to fetch, leading to a larger and larger resolver
  - E.g., `Human` may have a `Contact` field, with data in another table
- Query performance may suffer from loading more relations
- Still over fetching
  - Even if we aren't interested in `owners` data, the `animal` resolver is still fetching it

---

# Example 2

##

Now, we'll create a resolver for the `owners` field on the `Animal` type.

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async animal({ parent, args, { db } }): Promise<Animal> {
      const animal = await db.queryRow(
        `SELECT id, name, age FROM animals WHERE id = $1`,
        args["id"]
      );
      return animal;
    },
  },
  Animal: {
    async owners({ parent, args, { db } }): Promise<Owner[]> {
      const owners = await db.query(
        `SELECT id, name FROM owners WHERE animal_id = $1`,
        parent["id"]
      );
      return owners;
    },
  },
};
```

---

# Example 2

## Pros

- Simpler resolver, fetches only the data needed to satisfy the scalar fields of an `Animal`
- Allows us to completely omit a DB query if we don't need `owners` data

## Cons

- Slightly more complex, requires a secondary resolver function
- Brings us to the GraphQL N+1 query problem

---

# The N+1 query problem

A bad day to be a field.

The N+1 query problem generally refers to a query that results in multiple sequential DB operations.

- Fetching a list of data, and including a field resolver
- Fetching nested fields, which may require their own resolvers to be run
- Fetching recursive data structures, which may require the same queries to be run

Resolvers are executed independently and sequentially, they don't have a native batching mechanism.

---

# An example of N+1

New requirements for our pet friends API

Let's imagine we have a new requirement to include `Contact` data in our API.

```graphql
type Query {
  animal(id: ID!): Animal
}

type Animal {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  owners: [Human!]
}

type Human {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  contact: Contact!
}

type Contact {
  phone: String!
}
```

---

# An example of N+1

Some issues become apparent.

If we have a pet with 50 owners (weird) and we need the contact info, we're going to execute 1 query to fetch owners, and then 50 queries to fetch each owners contact. Resulting in 51 operations.

```typescript {|}{maxHeight: '70%'}
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    async animal({ parent, args, { db }}): Promise<Animal> {
      // ... fetch the animal
    },
  },
  Animal: {
    async owners({ parent, args, { db }}): Promise<Owner[]> {
      // ... fetch the owners
    },
  },
  Human: {
    // This will be executed 50 times
    async contact({ parent, args, { db }}): Promise<Contact> {
      // We're hitting the DB 50 times
      const contact = await db.queryRow(
        `SELECT id, email, phone FROM contact WHERE human_id = $1`,
        parent["id"]
      );
      return contact;
    }
  }
};
```

---

# Enter dataloader

The batch and cache master

- Dataloader is a utility that provides batching and request scoped caching
- It helps us batch expensive operations like DB requests, and can minimize the effect of the N+1 problem
- A dataloader is initialized with a batching function
- Our resolvers call a `load` method on the dataloader and await the results

---

# How dataloader is initialized

- We initialize a data loader with a batch function
- This batch function accepts an array of keys and returns a promise with an array of results
- Our code doesn't interact with the batch function directly, instead it calls a `load` method on the dataloader

```typescript
async function batchLoadContacts(keys: string[]): Promise<Contact[]> {
  // Now, we're hitting the DB once
  const contacts = await db.query(
    `SELECT id, email, phone FROM contact WHERE human_id IN ($1)`,
    keys
  );
  return contacts;
}

// We initialize the dataloader with our batching function
const contactLoader = new DataLoader(batchLoadContacts);
```

---

# How dataloader is used

##

Now our resolver simply calls the `load` method.

The `contact` resolver is still called 50 times (one for each owner). But the expensive DB operation has been collapsed into a single call.

```typescript
const resolvers = {
  // ... other resolvers
  Human: {
    // This is still executed 50 times
    async contact({ parent, args, { db }}): Promise<Contact> {
      // But now we're calling the dataloader which handles the DB call for us, resulting in 1 DB call
      const contact = await contactLoader.load(parent["id"]);
      return contact;
    }
  }
};
```

---

# Dataloader constraints

##

To use dataloader effectively, the following batch function constraints must be met

- The array of values returned from the batch function must be the same length as the array of keys
- The array of values must be in the same order as the array of keys

Example

```typescript
// keys = ["1", "2", "3"]
function batchLoadContacts(keys: string[]): Promise<Contact[]> {
  // the DB has no value for key "2"
  const contacts = await db.query(
    `SELECT id, email, phone FROM contact WHERE human_id IN ($1)`,
    keys
  );
  // contacts = [{"email": "user1@fake.com"}, {"email": "user3@fake.com"}]
  return contacts;
  // contacts must be = [{"email": "user1@fake.com"}, null, {"email": "user3@fake.com"}]
}
```

# Recap

We've covered a lot

- Our queries can return scalar values (strings, numbers, etc) or complex values like objects
- The objects we return have their own fields, these can also be scalar values or complex types
- We have options for handling how this data is returned
- We can write big resolvers that try to return as much as possible, or break fields into their own resolvers
- More resolvers can mean the N+1 query problem
- N+1 query problem can introduce serious performance issues
- Dataloader can help with these issues

---

# Field resolvers, a GraphQL panacea?

Oh boy, this question again

## Absolutely not

Just like with everything else in engineering, we have multiple options to weigh.

- Is it more likely for the field to be included or excluded in the query?
  - If its more likely to be excluded it may be a good field resolver candidate
- Are you modeling highly relational data?
  - Probably a good candidate for a field resolver, especially if you're needing more and more joins to get all the data
- Does the data for your field have an expensive operation to fetch it?
  - Probably a good candidate for a field resolver
- Are you modeling recursive data?
  - Definitely a good time to use a field resolver
